        <h2>About Pizza</h2>
        <p>Pizza, a dish with origins in Italy, is one of the world's most beloved foods. It was first made in Naples during the 18th century, with the classic Margherita pizza being named after Queen Margherita of Savoy. The traditional pizza is known for its simple ingredients: a thin crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil.</p>
        <p>Over the years, pizza has evolved into a variety of regional styles, from thin-crust New York-style pizza to deep-dish Chicago pizza. While the toppings have diversified, the tradition of sharing a pizza with family and friends remains an essential part of the pizza experience.</p>
        <p>In Italy, pizza is often enjoyed casually, typically paired with a glass of wine or soda. It is a symbol of Italian culture, and many believe that a good pizza is a representation of the country's culinary expertise and passion for food.</p>
        <p>Pizza's global reach has led to many variations and adaptations in different countries. In Japan, for example, toppings like teriyaki chicken and squid are popular, while in Brazil, green peas and corn are commonly found on pizzas. In the United States, pizza has become a staple of fast food, with different regions offering their unique twists, such as the deep-dish pizza from Chicago and the thin crust of New York City.</p>
